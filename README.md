# Learning about [Material Design Components for the Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

[Components listed as npm packages](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages), for example: [mcd-button](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-button).

```bash
npm install @material/textfield @material/button
```
